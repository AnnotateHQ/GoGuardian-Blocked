    GOGUARDIAN BLOCKED PAGE CLONE
    =============================

    goguardian developers should step up
    page paths:
      - /teacher/block
      - /parent/block
      - /parent/pause
      - /x3/block


    thanks goguardian for exposing all this on /teacher/block code <3
    this site is on github, see https://github.com/AnnotateHQ/GoGuardian-Blocked

    i don't care what you do for this code as long as you are misusing it.
    credit to goguardian for the code :)
